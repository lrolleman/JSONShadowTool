The JSONShadow Tool

A simple crude tool for creating quick shadowed JSON files

main function is in JSONShadow.java

Recommended you load it into eclipse and run from there, it handles all compiling for you. 

Unless you wish to change the functionality of the program, you should only have to modify ActionList.java. This does not require
any specific java knowledge.
